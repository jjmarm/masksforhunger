    header: Help people get the food they need during the COVID-19 crisis
    about: >-
      Because of COVID-19, many people have lost their jobs, gotten their salary
      cut, or have been affected in other very extreme ways. Instead of worrying
      about whether or not their sport season was canceled, these people are
      worried about whether or not they have enough food for themselves. Even
      worse, if they have enough food for their children.


      I decided I did not just want to stand by while the whole world was struggling through the effects, big or small, of the outbreak. I wanted to help, and joining Masks for Hunger was the perfect opportunity.


      By making a donation, you will be helping those in need of food due to COVID-19. We are immensely grateful for anything you can do!
    maskInstructions: >-
      Masks for Hunger is an initiative to raise awareness about food for all
      during this crisis. You're welcome to donate without getting a mask. Just
      [click
      here](https://www.fooddriveonline.org/sandiegofoodbank/MasksforHunger) to
      donate to my virtual food drive!


      However, if you do wish to get a mask, just follow these simple steps:


      1. [Click here](https://www.fooddriveonline.org/sandiegofoodbank/MasksforHunger) to be directed to my virtual food drive with the San Diego Food Bank and press "start". Select the items you would like to donate by moving them off the shelf and "scanning" each one at the cash register. As you scan, each item will show up on the reciept to the right of the cash register. A pledge of at least $25 is recommended to get a mask.

      2. Once you have scanned all the items you would like to donate, press "checkout". You will then be asked to fill out a donation form with payment information.

      3. Once you have completed your donation, browse the selection of masks and click on the link called "I want a mask" in the "Contact" section below. You should receive a response by mail shortly.


      Again, you aren't required to get a mask to contribute! All remaining masks will be given to local hospitals or non-profits on the frontline.

    header: Help people get the food they need during the COVID-19 crisis
    about: >-
      The unprecedented COVID-19 Pandemic has affected everyone globally in
      different ways. Some of us have to start distance learning, some are
      juggling taking care of their children and working from home, and many
      have lost jobs and their flow of income has been disrupted. In some cases,
      people are not able to put food on the table for themselves or their loved
      ones.


      I am very lucky and grateful to not be heavily affected by the virus, but I know that watching the struggling world through rose colored glasses is not an option. By joining Masks for Hunger, I want to make a difference directly to those who are struggling.


      By donating towards the fundraiser, you can make a difference and help others. Remember, we are all in this together!
