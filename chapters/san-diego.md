about: >-
  For some people, COVID-19 is a large inconvenience. Events and activities have
  been canceled, but nothing too serious has happened. However, many people have
  lost their jobs, gotten their salary cut, or have been affected in other very
  extreme ways. Instead of worrying about whether or not their sport season was
  canceled, these people are worried about whether or not they have enough food
  for themselves. Even worse, if they have enough food for their children.


  I decided I did not just want to stand by while the whole world was struggling through the effects, big or small, of the outbreak. I wanted to help, and joining Masks for Hunger was the perfect opportunity.


  By making a donation, you will be helping those in need of food due to COVID-19. We are immensely grateful for anything you can do!

  Masks for Hunger is an initiative to raise awareness about food for all during
  this crisis. You're welcome to donate without getting a mask. Just [click
  here](https://www.fooddriveonline.org/sandiegofoodbank/MasksforHunger) to
  donate to my virtual food drive!


  However, if you do wish to get a mask, just follow these simple steps:


  1. [Click here](https://www.fooddriveonline.org/sandiegofoodbank/MasksforHunger) to be directed to my virtual food drive and press "start". Select the items you would like to donate by moving them off the shelf and "scanning" each one at the cash register. As you scan, each item will show up on the reciept to the right of the cash register. A pledge of at least $25 is recommended to get a mask. 

  2. Once you have scanned all the items you would like to donate, press "checkout". You will then be asked to fill out a donation form with payment information.

  3. Once you have completed your donation, browse the selection of masks below and fill out the form called "I want a mask". You should receive a response by mail shortly.


  Again, you aren't required to get a mask to contribute! All remaining masks will be given to local hospitals or non-profits on the frontline.
