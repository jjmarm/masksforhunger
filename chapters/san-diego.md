about: >-
  For some people, COVID-19 is a large inconvenience. Events and activities have
  been canceled, but nothing too serious has happened. However, many people have
  lost their jobs, gotten their salary cut, or have been affected in other very
  extreme ways. Instead of worrying about whether or not their sport season was
  canceled, these people are worried about whether or not they have enough food
  for themselves. Even worse, if they have enough food for their children.


  I decided I did not just want to stand by while the whole world was struggling through the effects, big or small, of the outbreak. I wanted to help, and joining Masks for Hunger was the perfect opportunity.


  By making a donation, you will be helping those in need of food due to COVID-19. We are immensely grateful for anything you can do!

  However, if you do wish to get a mask, just follow these steps:


  1. Make a donation to my [virtual food drive](https://www.fooddriveonline.org/sandiegofoodbank/MasksforHunger)[](https://secure.projectbread.org/site/Donation2?idb=1934012782&df_id=6233&FR_ID=1400&mfc_pref=T&PROXY_ID=2304152&PROXY_TYPE=20&6233.donation=form1&pw_id=3761&s_AffiliateSecCatId=2341&NONCE_TOKEN=0D63D32F6732BC089ED848A192544239). A pledge of at least $25 is recommended to get a mask. To do donate, drag the item(s) you would like to donate to cash register like you are scanning them. Each item you successfully scan will form a list on the receipt to the right of the register. When you have all the desired items, click "Checkout", and fill out the donation form.
