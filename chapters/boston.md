    header: Help people get the food they need during the COVID-19 Crisis
    about: >-
      In recent years I have participated in the Walk For Hunger with Project
      Bread, an organization that works towards ensuring that families and
      children have food for the weekend, and are helping to combat the global
      hunger crisis in our local communities.


      Due to COVID-19, The Walk for Hunger on May 3, 2020 was cancelled but the fundraising must continue; with the being focus primarily on rapid response to food insecurity being caused by the COVID-19 crisis.


      However, the driving force of this organization is that **HUNGER NEVER STOPS**!


      I decided to be a virtual walker partnering with my mother's efforts to help the community navigate through this new environment. I am encouraging you to donate to my fundraiser to help families that are not as fortunate as us in these times. With your generous donations we give you the opportunity to pick a mask from a selection of our beautifully homemade fabric masks.

    maskInstructions: >-
      Masks for Hunger is an initiative to raise awareness about food for all
      during this crisis. You're welcome to donate without getting a mask. Just
